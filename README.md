## üîÑ How It Works (Non-Technical Explanation)

### Firebase Integration

The app uses Google's Firebase platform as its backend, which provides:

- **User Accounts**: Securely stores user credentials and profiles
- **Product Database**: Stores all product information and inventory
- **Order Processing**: Manages the lifecycle of customer orders
- **File Storage**: Stores product images and other media
- **Analytics**: Tracks app usage to improve user experience

### State Management Explained

The app uses a system called "Provider" to manage data across screens. Think of it as a central bulletin board where different parts of the app can post and read information. This ensures all screens show consistent, up-to-date information.

## üõí Product System

Products in the app have the following properties:

- **Basic Info**: Name, description, price, images
- **Categories**: Products are organized by type (e.g., Eggs, Vegetables)
- **Special Tags**: Organic, Featured, Discounted, etc.
- **Inventory Management**: Tracks available quantities
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Customer feedback and star ratings

## üì¶ Order Processing Workflow

1. **Cart Creation**: User adds products to their shopping cart
2. **Checkout**: User provides delivery information and payment details
3. **Order Placement**: System creates an order and processes payment
4. **Status Updates**: Order progresses through various stages:
   - Pending ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Shipped ‚Üí Delivered (or Cancelled)
5. **Notifications**: User receives updates about their order status

## üë• User Roles

### Customer Features
- Browse and search products

### Overview (2025)
- Firebase is the single source of truth for all data (products, orders, reviews, users, activities).
- Firestore index errors are avoided by using client-side filtering/sorting where needed.
- Image uploads use Firebase Storage primarily, with Cloudinary as a robust fallback.
- State management uses `provider` with properly registered providers in `lib/main.dart`.
- Admin Order Management Screen has a modern UI with analytics, filters, and real-time updates.

### Quick Start
1) Prerequisites
   - Flutter SDK (3.16+ recommended)
   - Dart SDK (3.2+)
   - Android Studio/Xcode (for platforms you target)
   - Firebase project (Firestore, Authentication, Storage enabled)
   - Optional: Cloudinary account (for fallback uploads)

2) Clone & Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gustav2k22/eggstra-farms-ltd.git
cd eggstra-farms-ltd
flutter pub get
```

3) Configure Firebase (see next section) and ensure files are in the correct platform folders.

4) Optional: provide Cloudinary config via `--dart-define` (recommended)
```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud \
  --dart-define=CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_key \
  --dart-define=CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_secret \
  --dart-define=CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=eggstra \
  --dart-define=CLOUDINARY_UNSIGNED=true
```

5) Run
```bash
flutter run
```

### Environment & Configuration
The app reads Firebase configuration from the standard platform config files:
- Android: `android/app/google-services.json`
- iOS: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

Cloudinary configuration is currently defined in `lib/core/services/cloudinary_service.dart`.
- Fields: `cloudName`, `apiKey`, `apiSecret`, `upload_preset` (currently `'eggstra'`).
- For production, consider moving these to a secure config mechanism.

### Firebase Setup
1) Create a Firebase project and enable:
   - Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Firestore
   - Storage
   - (Optional) Analytics/Crashlytics

2) Add apps (Android/iOS/web) in the Firebase console and download config files:
   - Android: place `google-services.json` at `android/app/`
   - iOS: place `GoogleService-Info.plist` at `ios/Runner/`

3) Initialize FlutterFire (optional but recommended):
```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

4) Firestore Rules (example starting point; harden for production):
```txt
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Cloudinary Setup (Fallback Image Upload)
1) Create a Cloudinary account and get:
   - Cloud name
   - API Key
   - API Secret

2) Create an unsigned upload preset named `eggstra` (or update the code to your preset).

3) In `lib/core/services/cloudinary_service.dart` ensure these are correct:
   - `cloudName`, `apiKey`, `apiSecret`, `_uploadUrl`, and `upload_preset`.
   - Signature generation now uses proper SHA1 via `package:crypto`.

### Running the App
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Common run targets:
- Android emulator/physical device
- iOS simulator/device

### Architecture (2025)
- UI: Widgets in `lib/features/**` and shared widgets in `lib/shared/widgets/`.
- State: `provider`-based; `MultiProvider` registration in `lib/main.dart`.
- Services: Encapsulated Firebase/Cloudinary logic in `lib/core/services/`.
- Models: POJOs and mapping in `lib/core/models/`.

### Data Flow
- Read: Services expose streams or futures (e.g., `OrderService.getUserOrders()` returns user orders with client-side filtering to avoid composite indexes).
- Write: Services validate and write to Firestore/Storage, with activity logging where applicable.
- Images: Upload to Firebase Storage; on failure, fallback to Cloudinary; on failure again, fallback to local storage (graceful degradation).

### Key Features (Technical)
- Client-side filtering instead of Firestore composite indexes for queries combining `where + orderBy` to avoid index issues.
- Admin Order Management: real-time stream, statistics, search/filter, polished UI.
- Product reviews: Firebase-backed with rating aggregation.
- Activity tracking for admin dashboard.

### Error Handling & Troubleshooting
- __StorageException: object-not-found__
  - Ensure Firebase Storage rules allow the operation and the path exists.
  - Verify the file path/key and that uploads are not canceled prematurely.

- __Cloudinary 401 Invalid Signature__
  - Fixed in code: signatures now use SHA1 with `package:crypto` and include `upload_preset` in the signature string.
  - Verify `upload_preset` exists and matches, API key/secret are correct.

- __Missing google_app_id (Analytics disabled)__
  - Ensure `google-services.json` / `GoogleService-Info.plist` are present at the correct locations.
  - Re-run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`.

- __ProviderNotFoundException__
  - Confirm providers are registered in `lib/main.dart` within `MultiProvider`.

- __Firestore index errors__
  - Handled by moving filtering/sorting to client-side for affected queries (no paid indexes required).

### Quality: Linting & Formatting
- Run analyzer: `flutter analyze`
- Fix common issues (unused imports, deprecated APIs). Some remaining warnings may be informational.
- Optional: add `melos` or custom scripts for CI.

### Security Notes
- Do not commit real secrets. Use environment configs or secure storage.
- The constant `defaultAdminKey` is preserved in the codebase where required. Restrict its usage and rotate if needed.
- Harden Firebase rules before production launch.

### Contributing (2025)
1) Create a feature branch.
2) Keep changes small and focused.
3) Run `flutter analyze` and ensure no new warnings.
4) Open a PR with a clear description, screenshots (if UI), and testing notes.
