## üîÑ How It Works (Non-Technical Explanation)

### Firebase Integration

The app uses Google's Firebase platform as its backend, which provides:

- **User Accounts**: Securely stores user credentials and profiles
- **Product Database**: Stores all product information and inventory
- **Order Processing**: Manages the lifecycle of customer orders
- **File Storage**: Stores product images and other media
- **Analytics**: Tracks app usage to improve user experience

### State Management Explained

The app uses a system called "Provider" to manage data across screens. Think of it as a central bulletin board where different parts of the app can post and read information. This ensures all screens show consistent, up-to-date information.

## üõí Product System

Products in the app have the following properties:

- **Basic Info**: Name, description, price, images
- **Categories**: Products are organized by type (e.g., Eggs, Vegetables)
- **Special Tags**: Organic, Featured, Discounted, etc.
- **Inventory Management**: Tracks available quantities
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Customer feedback and star ratings

## üì¶ Order Processing Workflow

1. **Cart Creation**: User adds products to their shopping cart
2. **Checkout**: User provides delivery information and payment details
3. **Order Placement**: System creates an order and processes payment
4. **Status Updates**: Order progresses through various stages:
   - Pending ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Shipped ‚Üí Delivered (or Cancelled)
5. **Notifications**: User receives updates about their order status
